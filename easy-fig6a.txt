Inspector user: prompted to enter a restaurant inspection report. Fig 6a.

The item description, critical attribute, and item number are all static rows of information,
constant always. They are initialized once at the application setup, and 
later for the life of the application they are always read from.

To display fig 6a, the following simple query is used.

select itemnum, description, critical
 from item

The user will enter : u_inspectorID, u_restaurantID, u_date,
 and fifteen score numeric values: sc1, ..., sc15.

The validation should ensure the constraints 
sc1 ... sc8 are ∈ {0, ..., 9} , and
sc9 ... sc15 are ∈ {0, ..., 4}
are met and should not accept input otherwise.
